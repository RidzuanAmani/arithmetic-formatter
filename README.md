# Arithmetic Formatter

A Python tool to format arithmetic problems (e.g., "32 + 698") vertically with optional answers, built for freeCodeCampâ€™s Scientific Computing with Python certification. Demonstrates string alignment, error handling, and basic calculations.

## Features
- Formats addition/subtraction problems with single-space separation.
- Handles errors (too many problems, invalid format, etc.).
- Displays answers if requested.

## What I Learned
- String alignment with rjust(), inspired by Case Converter.
- Error handling, similar to validation in Luhn.
- List joining for output, from Arithmetic Formatter practice.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RidzuanAmani/arithmetic-formatter.git`
2. Run the script: `python arithmetic_formatter.py`
3. Test with: `arithmetic_arranger(["3801 - 2", "123 + 49"], True)`
